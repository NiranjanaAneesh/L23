    <h2>JavaScript Objects and its Properties</h2>
    <p>An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A
    property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. Objects in JavaScript, just as in
    many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life.</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        // Create an object:
        var person = {
            FirstName: "Niranjana",
            age: 13,

        };
        // Display some data from the object:
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.FirstName + " is " + person.age + " years old";
    </script>
</body>
